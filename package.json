For the routing purpose react-router is used and specifically hashBrowserRouter is used because it has enchanced performance on react Hosting. The hosting is done on firebase at <a href=\"https://twobrother-0927.firebaseapp.com/#/\" target=\"_blank\"> <abbr title=\"Link to my website\"> Website </abbr> </a> </p>   <p> I created this website last year for a local shop owner but later on when I didn't sell it, I thought to make it open source and here it is. Feel free to use the provided components and code in your website just provide the copyright </p>",
